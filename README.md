### Notes

- The enriching of the Dataset is included in the main React component. However, this is just to show how it would be done and wouldn't normally be added to production code.

- Additional packaged added for range slider @radix-ui/react-slider 

- npm version used during development: 10.5.1


# Pok√©mon Search Experience with Algolia

## üëâ Objective
Develop a responsive web application that enables users to search for Pok√©mon using Algolia. This involves integrating with the Pok√©API to enrich the Pok√©mon data and implementing dynamic search features with filters, including a language switcher to display Pok√©mon names in multiple languages.

## üìù Requirements
- Proficiency in frontend web development (HTML, CSS/Tailwind, JavaScript).
- Basic knowledge of Algolia and its InstantSearch library.
- Use external APIs (Pok√©API).
- Creativity in UI/UX design.

## ü´£ Assignment Details

### Part 1: Dataset Preparation and Enrichment
1. **Initial Setup with Algolia**:
   - Sign up to Algolia and create a new application. [sign up page](https://dashboard.algolia.com/users/sign_up)

2. **Download the Provided Pok√©mon Dataset**:
   - Begin with the basic dataset provided. [Pokedex.json](pokedex/pokedex.json)
   - Upload the data to your Algolia Application, creating your first index.

4. **Enrich the Dataset Using [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/)**:
   - The provided dataset is missing crucial information like `images` and `game_versions`. Enrich the your Algolia Index using the Pok√©API.
   - For each Pok√©mon, retrieve:
     - The image URL, storing it in an `imageUrl` field.
     - The list of game versions it appears in, transforming this into a `game_versions` array.
   - Use Algolia‚Äôs `browseObjects` method to fetch existing records, enrich them with Pok√©API information, and update your dataset using `partialUpdateObjects` to include `game_versions` and `imageUrl`.
   - You can use the Algolia API Docs to conduct your data transformation. [Documentation API](https://www.algolia.com/doc/)

#### Expected Format of a Final Record in your newly Algolia Dashboard

```json
{
  "id": 15,
  "name": {
    "english": "Beedrill",
    "japanese": "„Çπ„Éî„Ç¢„Éº",
    "chinese": "Â§ßÈíàËúÇ",
    "french": "Dardargnan"
  },
  "type": ["Bug", "Poison"],
  "base": {
    "HP": 65,
    "Attack": 90,
    "Defense": 40,
    "Sp. Attack": 45,
    "Sp. Defense": 80,
    "Speed": 75
  },
  "game_versions": ["Red", "Blue", "Yellow", "Gold", "Silver", "Crystal"],
  "imageUrl": "https://example.com/beedrill-image.png"
}
```

### Part 2: Building the Search Experience
1. **Project Setup**: Choose your preferred web development framework and set up the project. Use Tailwind or standard CSS/SASS for styling. You can also use the react-boilerplate that is provided in this repository. This boilerplate include:
- Typescript
- Tailwind
- Instant Search

2. **Algolia Integration**:
  - Implement Algolia search in your application using the InstantSearch library. [Instant Search Documentation](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/what-is-instantsearch/js/)

3. **Search Interface**:
  - **Search Bar**: Create a search bar to initiate searches.
  - **Search Results**: Display dynamic search results, showing each Pok√©mon's image, name, type, and stats.
  - **Filters**:
    - Implement filters using instant search custom widget for Pok√©mon type, game versions, and at least one stat (using a range slider).
    - Ensure the UI for these filters is intuitive and user-friendly.
  - **Language Switcher**: Implement a dropdown to switch the display language of Pok√©mon names. Support English, Japanese, Chinese, and French.
  - **Persistent Preferences**: Use local storage or any state manager with persistent services to save the user‚Äôs language preference and Pok√©mon team across page reloads.

Attached is a wireframe outlining the proposed design for your user interface. That said, feel free to exercise as much creativity as you wish.
